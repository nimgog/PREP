# The Role of Bone Broth in Food and Water Storage for Prepping

When considering food and water storage for emergency preparedness, bone broth emerges as a versatile and nutritious option. This guide will delve into the benefits of bone broth, how to source and store it, and its integration into a comprehensive food and water storage plan.

### **Health Benefits of Bone Broth**

Bone broth is not just a flavorful base for soups and stews; it offers numerous health benefits that make it a valuable addition to any prepper's pantry:

- **Supports Joint Health**: Rich in collagen, bone broth can help maintain joint health and reduce pain and stiffness.
- **Boosts Gut Health**: The gelatin in bone broth supports healthy digestion by binding with water and aiding the movement of food through the intestines.
- **Enhances Immune Function**: The amino acids in bone broth, such as glutamine, can support the intestinal barrier and boost immune health.
- **High-Quality Protein**: Bone broth is an excellent source of easily digestible protein, essential for muscle maintenance and overall health.
- **Improves Skin Elasticity**: Collagen from bone broth can enhance skin health, improving hydration and reducing wrinkles.
- **Rich in Minerals**: Bone broth provides essential minerals like calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus, crucial for bone health and metabolic functions.

### **Sourcing Bones for Bone Broth**

Finding quality bones is crucial for making nutritious bone broth. Knowing where to find bones for bone broth can significantly impact the quality and flavor of your final product:

- **Local Butchers and Farmers Markets**: These are excellent places to find bones from grass-fed or pasture-raised animals. Look for knuckle bones, chicken feet, and marrow bones. These sources often provide the freshest and most nutrient-rich options.
- **Grocery Stores**: Many grocery stores sell bone-in cuts of meat and soup bones. These are often affordable and readily available. Some stores even have sections specifically for bones and offal.
- **Online Retailers**: Websites like US Wellness Meats offer a variety of bones specifically for broth, including beef, lamb, pork, and chicken bones. Online options can provide access to specialty items and bulk purchases.
- **Local Farms**: Establishing a relationship with local farms can ensure a steady supply of high-quality bones. Farms that practice sustainable and humane animal husbandry are ideal.
- **Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) Programs**: Joining a CSA can provide access to a variety of farm products, including bones for broth. This can also support local agriculture and ensure the ethical treatment of animals.

### **Making Bone Broth**

#### **Ingredients**
- 2-4 pounds of animal bones (beef, chicken, pork, or lamb)
- 1 gallon of water
- 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar
- Vegetables (onions, carrots, celery)
- Aromatics (garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns)
- Salt and pepper to taste

#### **Instructions**
1. **Roast the Bones**: For enhanced flavor, roast the bones at 400°F for about 30 minutes. This step caramelizes the bones, adding depth to the broth.
2. **Simmer**: Place the bones in a large pot, cover with water, and add vinegar, vegetables, and aromatics. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. The vinegar helps extract minerals from the bones.
3. **Cook**: Simmer for 12-24 hours, skimming off any foam. The longer the simmer, the more nutrients are extracted.
4. **Strain**: Remove the bones and vegetables, then strain the broth through a fine mesh sieve. For a clearer broth, use cheesecloth.
5. **Store**: Let the broth cool, then store it in airtight containers in the fridge or freezer. Cooling quickly in an ice bath can help maintain freshness.

### **Storing Bone Broth**

Proper storage is essential to maintain the quality and safety of bone broth:

- **Refrigeration**: Store in airtight containers in the fridge for up to 5 days. Glass jars or BPA-free plastic containers are ideal.
- **Freezing**: Freeze bone broth in ice cube trays, gallon bags, or plastic jars. Ice cube trays allow for easy portioning, while gallon bags are suitable for larger quantities. Bone broth can be stored in the freezer for up to a year. Label containers with the date to track freshness.
- **Pressure Canning**: For long-term storage without refrigeration, pressure canning is an excellent option. Follow proper canning guidelines to ensure safety.

### **Integrating Bone Broth into Food Storage**

Bone broth can be a cornerstone of your emergency food supplies due to its versatility and nutritional benefits:

- **Base for Soups and Stews**: Use bone broth as a base for soups and stews to enhance flavor and nutrition. It can stretch simple ingredients into hearty meals.
- **Nutritious Drink**: Drink bone broth on its own for a health boost, especially during cold and flu season. It can also serve as a comforting and hydrating drink in emergencies.
- **Cooking Liquid**: Use bone broth instead of water for cooking grains or vegetables to add extra nutrients. This can make even basic foods more nourishing.
- **Hydration and Electrolytes**: Bone broth can help maintain hydration and provide electrolytes, which are crucial during emergencies when access to balanced meals may be limited.
